<h3>
Mauritius is well known in the Western World as a Paradise Holiday Island, with moderate weather patterns (usually sunny) and beautiful pristine beaches and clear/clean water… 
It is the sort of DREAM HOLIDAY destination in many minds!
Located off the coast of Africa, it is well serviced by several international airlines with direct connection flights from London, Paris, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Perth, Kuala Lumpur .
The island is a unique bi-lingual multi-cultural society… Almost boutique in its existence, Mauritius offers a peaceful, politically stable society with unmatched cultural diversity and an environment where French and English happily co-exist as the generally spoken languages.
