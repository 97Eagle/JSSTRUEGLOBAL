<h3>
More than just a beach and holiday destination, modern Mauritius has been busy reinventing itself from a primarily agricultural economy (Sugarcane Paradise), into a desirable regional HUB for Education and Financial services.  
With growth encouraging incentives, and inviting tax concessions, the Island has successfully attracted major International investment in the last decade and now offers a thriving economy with good employment opportunities and strong business confidence.  Of course, the democratic traditions, and relatively stable politics, have encouraged investment and Mauritian education and the broad international experience is bot held in regard and appreciated in the fast-developing world.

	<li> Will they feel safe and reassured? </li> </li> </ul>
	<li> Hygiene Factors
	<ul>
		<li>Are there good facilities? (accommodation, food, cleaning) </li>
		<li> Will they be comfortable? And Looked after? </li> </li> </ul>
	<li> Distance/Connection
<ul>	
	<li> How far? and Ease of Travel + Good Communication </li>
	<li> Ease of travel and distance from home? </li> </ul>
